DEV LOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1 (1/19/2023)
-----------------
Pseudocode written out. Ended up making some tweaks because I realized I did not need a while loop 
to get the first two values in the text file.

Struggled greatly trying to get either VirtualBox working or WSL w/ Ubuntu but to no avail. Ended 
up falling back on Visual Studio for now. Hopefully I can get that sorted soon.

So far I have the file being read in successfully and stored the first two values in variables to 
be used in the 2d array.

Stopping Point: Tried figuring out how to put char's read from reader into array.



I was able to get the array built with empty char's based on the dimensions pulled from the text
file.
